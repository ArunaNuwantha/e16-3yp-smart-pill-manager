## Problem

Let me ask you something...

      Did you ever forget to take pills at the prescribed time?Yes???? 
      OK! we all do forget right??
      You may think having an irregular schedule to take medication is not
      much of a problem. We thought so too. but to be sure, we ask about it
      from a DOCTOR.....
What he said

       It's better to not take medicines rather than having it irregularly
       unprescribed way

We astonished! We asked why?...

      He highlighted the following key issues that could arise because of this,                     

         1. Drug Overdose
         2. Drug Intolerance
         3. Disease gets worse
         4. Might feel withdrawal effects
         5. Can be caused Death

      He also stated,
         Elderly people have high possibility to develop This issues rather than 
         Younger people. So we thought to give a solution for this. But before 
         designing a solution we did a survey and found following issues
         associated with this.

So we design this project to address the most common two issues raised by the people.
 1. Being forgetful
 2. hard to read prescriptions due to poor vision
